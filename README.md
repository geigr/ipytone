# Ipytone

*Interactive audio in Jupyter*

[![JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge-launch.svg)](https://ipytone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/retro/notebooks/?path=quick_demo.ipynb)

Ipytone exposes many features of the [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) library
to Python as [Jupyter widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io). It allows
turning Jupyter into a versatile DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for music
creation, sound design, data sonification, and more...

...like this little piece of music entirely composed and played in a Jupyter notebook,
with a custom Earth Globe VU-meter!

### Development install

Development installation requires NodeJS and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) be
installed. You can easily install it with conda:

``` bash
conda install nodejs yarn -c conda-forge
```

Clone this repository, change directory to the ipytone directory and install the
package in development mode:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .

# if you use jupyterlab, you can also install the pre-built extension
# in development mode and re-build the extension (see below):
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
```

### Re-build the extension

After making changes to the typescript source code, you need to rebuild the extension:

``` bash
yarn run build

# or if you use jupyterlab
yarn run build:lib
yarn run build:labextension:dev
```

You can then refresh the notebook or JupyterLab in the browser to test the changes.

If you change the Python source, you need to reload the Python kernel.
